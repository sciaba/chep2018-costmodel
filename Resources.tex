\section{Resource estimation}
In order to sensibly plan their activity and estimate their costs,
experiments need to translate the requirements of their physics
programmes into computing resources needs. They thus need a modelling
tool that takes as input the details of the physics activities and the
features of the computing model and outputs the amount
and characteristics
of computing resources required.

Currently, all LHC experiments have their own tools for this task,
often some complex spreadsheets. Our purpose is to provide a common
framework that could standardise, generalise and possibly improve what
each experiment does, in its own specific way, today. This framework
should be as generic and customizable as possible, it should define a
schema for the parameters that describe the expected activity and the
characteristics of the computing model, and provide some standard
calculations on these parameters.  Besides providing the experiment
with a standardised way to compute their needs, such framework will
allow us to easily play with different computing model scenarios and
explore potential gains.

\subsection{Current status}
A first version of the framework \cite{ourresmodel} was obtained by
forking, refactoring and slightly generalising existing code used by
CMS to estimate HL-LHC requirements~\cite{cmsresmodel}. It is a set of
modules and scripts that read some inputs files and produces plots and
tables with the required storage and CPU resources. Inputs are loaded
hierarchically so that we can easily overwrite a generic set of
definitions with different special scenarios. This is handled by the
classes and functions defined in the {\it ResourceModel}
module. Parameters include:
\begin{itemize}
\item LHC parameters: trigger rates, live fractions, shutdown years, etc.
\item Computing model: event sizes and processing times, software improvement factors, etc.
\item Storage model: numbers of versions, replicas, etc.
\item Infrastructure: capacity model, T1 disk and tape, etc.
\end{itemize}
The framework computes the number of data and Monte Carlo events per
year using the LHC parameters and some physics information like the
required Monte Carlo/data ratio. The functions defined in the {\it
  CPUModel} and {\it StorageModel} modules translate the number of
events into CPU and Storage requirements for the different activities
(reconstruction, Monte Carlo, analysis).  The module {\it ModelOut}
defines functions to create plots and tables.

\subsection{Next steps}
This first version of the framework elicited strong interest from
other LHC experiments and has been tentatively agreed as a common
basis for future development. Generalising it to all LHC experiments
will require rewriting some of the most CMS-specific parts and making
the parameters schema more flexible. Even if a common framework was
not finally adopted by all LHC experiments, having them to adopt a
similar approach will greatly benefit the ability to produce
consistent and flexible resource estimates.  Other foreseen
improvements are a generic time granularity and an estimation of
network resources.
